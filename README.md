Document Management System with NLP and RAG Agent
This is a full-stack application built using FastAPI, designed to allow users to upload, store, and interact with documents of various formats (e.g., PDF, PPT, CSV) through advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system implements a RAG (Retrieve and Generate) agent to answer user queries based on the content of documents stored within the system. The application is scalable, secure, and deployable on Docker and Kubernetes.

Features
Document Upload & Management: Secure and efficient upload of multi-format documents (PDF, PPT, CSV, etc.) with real-time parsing and metadata extraction.
NLP Processing with LangChain/LlamaIndex: Utilize advanced NLP models for document indexing and query processing.
RAG (Retrieve and Generate) Agent: Context-aware responses to user queries by extracting relevant information from the stored documents.
User Authentication: Secure session-based login for users.
File Storage: AWS S3 for storing uploaded documents.
Document Parsing: Integrated unstructured.io for advanced content extraction and parsing.
Search Engine: Elasticsearch for searching document content efficiently.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Node.js (for React frontend)
Docker (for containerization)
Kubernetes (for optional cloud deployment)
AWS S3 credentials for file storage
PostgreSQL database running locally or remotely
Elasticsearch instance for querying document content
Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the PostgreSQL database by running the necessary migrations:

bash
Copy code
alembic upgrade head
Create a .env file for environment variables (e.g., database credentials, AWS credentials):

bash
Copy code
touch .env
Example of .env:

plaintext
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
Run the FastAPI backend:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the React frontend:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Docker Setup
Build the Docker images:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This will start both the frontend and backend in Docker containers.

Kubernetes Setup (Optional)
Create Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for deployment.

Deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster.

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
API Endpoints
POST /login
Description: Authenticates the user and generates an access token.
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "username": "user123",

}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "access_token": "your_token"
}
POST /upload
Description: Uploads a document (PDF, PPT, CSV, etc.) and stores it in AWS S3 with metadata.
Request:
file: The document file to upload.
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Document uploaded successfully",
  "file_url": "s3://your_bucket_name/document.pdf"
}
POST /query
Description: Queries a document for specific information using the RAG agent.
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
  "query": "What is the main topic of the document?"
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "response": "The main topic of the document is XYZ."

Low-Level Design (LLD)
Database Schema
User: Stores user credentials and information.
Fields: id, username, password_hash
Document: Stores document metadata and its associated file URL.
Fields: id, filename, file_type, url, user_id (foreign key)
Service Layer
Document Processing: Handles document upload, parsing, and storage in AWS S3.
NLP & RAG Agents: Handles the querying process using LangChain/LlamaIndex for efficient document processing and the RAG agent for generating answers.
Authentication: Manages user login, token generation, and session-based authentication.
Deployment Guide
Docker Setup
Build the Docker images:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Start the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
Kubernetes Setup
Create Kubernetes manifests (deployment.yaml, service.yaml, ingress.yaml).

Apply the manifests:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
Monitoring & Logging (Optional)
Prometheus: Collects metrics from the application, database, and middleware.
Grafana: Visualizes metrics through dashboards.
ELK Stack: Aggregates logs from the application for easier troubleshooting and monitoring.
